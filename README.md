# Task Management API

This repository contains a RESTful API for managing tasks (to-do items) built with Spring Boot. It demonstrates core concepts such as CRUD operations, database integration, Docker containerization, and CI/CD pipelines.

## Overview

The Task Management API allows users to:
- **Create**, **read**, **update**, and **delete** tasks.
- Manage tasks with attributes like title, description, status, and due date.
- Connect to a PostgreSQL database (with H2 available for local testing).

## Technologies

- **Java 11+**
- **Spring Boot**
- **Spring Data JPA**
- **PostgreSQL** (configurable, H2 for in-memory testing)
- **Docker & Docker Compose**
- **GitHub Actions** (CI/CD)
